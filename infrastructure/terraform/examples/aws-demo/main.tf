# Phase-A Honua Demo Environment — demo.honua.io
#
# Lambda container (AOT) + API Gateway HTTP API + RDS db.t4g.small + PostGIS.
# Optional Pro+AI demo add-ons, all gated off by default (see README → "Pro +
# AI demo drift"): a Secrets-Manager-delivered Pro license (enable_pro_license),
# a least-privilege Bedrock InvokeModel grant + WorkflowGeneration env for the
# AI studio (enable_bedrock_ai, plus the Bedrock VPC endpoint in vpc-endpoints.tf
# this no-NAT VPC requires), and an in-VPC ElastiCache Redis (enable_redis) for
# the durable feature-change event store /healthz/ready needs in Production.
# No WAF: API Gateway HTTP API does not support WAFv2 association; rate-limiting
# is handled via API Gateway throttle settings (see throttle variables below).
# See README.md for DNS prerequisites before applying.

  # loud: an unforwarded variable would be silently ignored, and a signed envelope
